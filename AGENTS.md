# lectual.app — project guidance

**What this is:** the final-MVP firm workspace for Lectual (Oath Innovation Inc). It is a new
**frontend** over the same Supabase backend as `theipgirl/lectual`. It is not a new backend.
Plan: `docs/MVP-PLAN.md`. Design: `design/` (one visual system; tokens live in
`src/app/globals.css`).

## Where the rules live
`theipgirl/lectual` owns the database, and its `AGENTS.md`, `brain/decisions.md` and
`supabase/migrations/` are binding here too. In particular:
- **No migrations in this repo.** Schema changes go in `lectual/supabase/migrations` (one chain,
  first-merged-wins numbering). Apply each one to BOTH lectual-dev and lectual-prod.
- **The tenant-isolation gate lives in `lectual`** (`tests/tenant-isolation.test.ts`), and every
  new tenant table adds a case there.
- **UPL firewall:** software, not a law firm; flat fees only; nothing implies legal advice.
- **Queue reads have three states** (`src/lib/queue/load.ts`): ok, unconfigured, unavailable. Never two.
- **Modules fail closed.** Gate the PAGE and the ACTION with `orgHasModule()`, and use `notFound()`.
  The rail (`src/lib/nav.ts`) is a courtesy, not the gate.
- **DB access:** only `getScopedClient()` (RLS on `active_org_id`). The service-role client
  (`src/lib/db/admin.ts`) is lint-fenced and only for jobs that stamp the row's own `org_id`.
- **Deploys:** production ships from `main` only. Never "Promote to Production" on a preview.

## Ported code
See `PORTED_FROM.md`. When changing a ported file, consider whether `lectual` needs the same fix.

## Commands
`pnpm build` · `pnpm lint` · `pnpm test`. Env: copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill it in
from lectual-dev.
